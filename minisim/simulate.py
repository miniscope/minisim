"""The ``simulate()`` orchestrator — compose a ``Spec`` into a ``Recording``.

This is the package's headline entry point: it walks ``spec.steps`` in order,
building and running each against a shared ``Scene``, then hands the exhausted
scene to :func:`~minisim.recording.finalize`. The loop itself is
deliberately tiny — the same readable ``for step in spec.steps`` a learner
follows — with two responsibilities beyond running the steps:

* **Motion margin sizing.** If the spec contains a ``brain_motion`` step, the
  tissue canvas must be padded by ≥ the maximum shift so real off-FOV tissue
  moves into view (see :mod:`minisim.steps.motion`). ``simulate``
  computes that margin from the motion spec and allocates the padded ``Scene``,
  so callers never hand-size it.
* **Per-stage snapshots.** With ``Output.save_intermediates`` set, the working
  movie is captured after each *movie-affecting* (non-``cell``-domain) step,
  keyed by the step's stage ``name`` (``cells_only``, ``neuropil``, …, ``sensor``
  — see ``simulation-spec.md`` §7). Cell-domain steps fill per-cell records, not
  the movie, so snapshotting them would only duplicate the prior (often blank)
  frame.

``until=<stage name>`` stops the run right after that stage — the partial-build
path the training notebook uses to reveal the pipeline one effect at a time.
