"""Mutable runtime state for the ``minisim`` pipeline.

Where :mod:`minisim.spec` is the *immutable* description of a
recording, this module is its *mutable* counterpart — the working state the
executable steps read and write as they run. The split mirrors the rest of the
design: a ``Spec`` is a frozen pydantic tree you can serialize and hash; a
``Scene`` is a plain dataclass the steps mutate in place.

A step (migration Step 5) is a small callable ``step(scene) -> None`` that
either fills the per-cell records in :attr:`Scene.cells`, composites into
:attr:`Scene.movie`, or records its ground-truth contribution on
:attr:`Scene.truth`. Tests construct a ``Scene`` directly — usually with
:meth:`Scene.zeros` or :meth:`Scene.ones` — and run a single step against it;
that, not the full ``simulate()`` loop, is the primary unit-test substrate.

This file (migration Step 4) provides the empty, correctly-shaped substrate and
its constructors only. The step bodies that populate it land in Step 5; the
``finalize()`` that turns an exhausted ``Scene`` into a ``Recording`` (and its
numpydantic ``GroundTruth``) lands with ``simulate()`` in Step 6.

class Cell:
    """One simulated neuron — the per-cell record steps fill in, pre-render.

    The fields mirror the per-cell structural columns of the eventual
    ``GroundTruth`` output (spec §8) one-for-one, so ``finalize()`` (Step 6) can
    stack them with no remapping. Each is populated by the step that owns it and
    is ``None`` until then:

    * ``center_um`` — set by ``place_neurons`` (the cell exists once it has a
      location). Placement is now purely spatial; brightness is not set here.
    * ``footprint_planted`` — the sharp, peak-normalized soma mask, also from
      ``place_neurons``; the ideal CNMF target.
    * ``trace`` / ``spikes`` / ``amplitude`` — the noise-free calcium trace
      ``C``, spike train ``S``, and the per-cell brightness/expression gain that
      scales the whole trace, all from ``cell_activity``. The gain is biology
      (how much fluorescence this cell emits per spike); measurement noise, and
      hence any SNR, emerges later from ``optics`` and ``sensor``, not here.
    * ``footprint_observed`` / ``in_focus`` / ``optical_brightness`` — the
      optically degraded footprint, the geometric in-focus flag, and the
      depth-driven peak-brightness scalar, all from the ``optics`` step (5b).
    * ``detectable`` is *not* an optics-only property and so is **not** set by
      the optics step: it is a whole-pipeline flag (optical brightness ×
      illumination falloff, judged against the sensor noise floor) assembled in
      ``finalize()`` (Step 6), per spec §8.

    ``center_um`` is ``(z, y, x)`` in µm (depth first); pixel coordinates are a
    conversion away via ``acq.um_to_px`` and are not stored, to avoid drift.

    ``None`` until the step that produces it runs, so a ``None`` value is the
    honest signal that the effect is absent from this recording:

    * ``shifts`` — rigid (dy, dx) per frame, from ``brain_motion``.

      components.
