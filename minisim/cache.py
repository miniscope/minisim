"""Spec-hash → zarr caching, kept as a thin library concern over :func:`simulate`.

A realistic spec takes tens of seconds to simulate, and parameter
sweeps re-request the same recordings many times. :func:`simulate_cached` keys a
recording by its :attr:`~minisim.spec.Spec.cache_key` (a hash of the
canonical spec JSON): a cache hit is loaded from disk, a miss simulates once and
saves the result. ``simulate()`` itself stays pure - it has no I/O and no disk
side effects - so caching composes on top rather than being baked in.

The cache directory defaults to ``~/.cache/minisim`` and is overridable with
the ``MINISIM_CACHE`` environment variable. Because ``output.save_intermediates``
(and every other knob) is part of the spec, it folds into the cache key - a
recording cached without snapshots can never falsely satisfy a request that wants
them; the keys simply differ.
