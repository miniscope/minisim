"""The executable-step contract for the ``minisim`` pipeline.

Where a ``StepSpec`` (:mod:`minisim.spec`) is the *immutable,
serializable description* of a step, a ``Step`` is its *executable counterpart*:
a small callable that mutates a :class:`~minisim.scene.Scene` in place.
``StepSpec.build()`` turns the former into the latter, binding it to the
``Acquisition`` (which owns every µm↔px / s↔frame conversion) and the RNG it
draws from.

A step does exactly one thing to the scene — fill per-cell records, composite
into the movie, or record a ground-truth contribution — so a single step can be
constructed and run against a hand-built ``Scene`` in a unit test. That, not the
full ``simulate()`` loop (migration Step 6), is the primary test substrate.

Each step captures the RNG handed to ``build()`` and draws from *that* generator
(not ``scene.rng``), so a step is reproducible from its construction regardless
of which scene it is later run against — matching the ``build(acq, rng)``
signature the orchestrator and the unit tests both use.
