"""Tissue-domain steps: composite the cells, then add brain-bound field effects.

The tissue domain is the brain-frame stack — everything that moves rigidly with
the tissue under :mod:`~minisim` motion (Step 5d), as opposed to the
static optics/sensor fields (:mod:`minisim.steps.sensor`). It opens
with ``render`` (the cell→image boundary) and then layers the diffuse/global
effects that ride on top of the cells:

* :class:`RenderStep` (``cells_only``) — composite ``Σ footprint·trace`` into the
  movie; the first step to write ``scene.movie``.
* :class:`NeuropilStep` (``neuropil``) — additive diffuse background, a smooth
  spatial field modulated by a slow temporal envelope.
* :class:`BleachingStep` (``bleaching``) — global multiplicative fluorophore
  decay over the recording.
* :class:`VasculatureStep` (``vasculature``) — honest no-op placeholder; the
  absorbing-vessel model is deferred to v1.1.

All run before the motion boundary, so a later ``brain_motion`` step translates
the cells *and* these fields together (they are part of the brain frame), unlike
the static vignette/leakage applied after motion.
