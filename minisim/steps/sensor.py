"""Sensor-domain steps: the static optical fields, then digitization.

The sensor domain is the *static* frame — effects fixed to the optics and
detector that do **not** move with the brain (unlike the tissue-frame steps in
:mod:`minisim.steps.tissue`). They are applied after the motion
boundary:

* :class:`VignetteStep` (``vignette``) — multiplicative radial illumination
  falloff (lumped excitation × collection efficiency).
* :class:`LeakageStep` (``leakage``) — additive static baseline, the "glow"
  minian's glow-removal subtracts.
* :class:`SensorStep` (``sensor``) — the only step that turns honest radiometric
  intensity into integer ADC counts (shot + read noise, gain, quantization).

The two field steps each record their static ``(height, width)`` field to ground
truth. The vignette field in particular is load-bearing downstream: ``finalize()``
(Step 6) reads it at each cell's lateral position to finish the per-cell
``detectable`` flag, since excitation falloff dims edge cells.
