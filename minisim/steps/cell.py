"""Cell-domain steps: place neurons, then give them calcium activity.

These are the first two steps of the forward pipeline — pure biology, before any
optics or sensor effect:

* :class:`PlaceNeuronsStep` positions neurons in a 3-D µm volume and stamps
  a sharp, pre-optics footprint for each. The *distribution* half (sampling
  centers only, no footprints) is factored into :func:`sample_neurons` so it can
  be reused cheaply for teaching/visualization at full FOV.
* :class:`CellActivityStep` gives every soma a calcium trace built from a
  2-state Markov spike model convolved with a double-exponential indicator
  kernel, plus a per-cell brightness gain that scales the trace.

Both only fill per-cell records on the scene (``scene.cells``); nothing is drawn
into the movie until ``render`` (:mod:`minisim.steps.tissue`). The
optical degradation that turns the *planted* (sharp) footprint into the
*observed* (blurred, attenuated) one is the next step, ``optics`` (migration
Step 5b); until it lands, ``render`` composites the planted footprint directly.

    """A sharp, peak-normalized neuron footprint — the *planted* spatial weight A.

    Models the cell's true (pre-optics) fluorophore support, with **no optical
    blur** — diffraction/defocus/scatter are applied later by the ``optics`` step.
    It is peak-normalized (``max == 1`` at the soma) so a cell's brightness is
    carried entirely by its calcium trace, not baked into the footprint.

    Two GCaMP targeting variants are supported via ``morphology``:

    * ``"soma"`` — soma-targeted GCaMP (e.g. SomaGCaMP / riboGCaMP): a single
      filled, possibly lumpy disk, the soma body only.
    * ``"cytosolic"`` — standard cytosolic GCaMP (GCaMP6/7/8…): the same soma
      disk plus ``n_dendrites`` tapering proximal dendrites. The dendrites are
      *graded* (dimmer than the soma) and *thin*, so they are exactly what
      diffraction, defocus, scatter, and the sensor noise floor erase first — a
      faithful demonstration of how quickly fine neurites become unresolvable.

    The soma is **identical** in both variants; ``"cytosolic"`` only *adds*
    dendrites after the soma is drawn, so ``"soma"`` (the default) reproduces the
    soma-only footprint bit-for-bit.

    ``irregularity`` ∈ [0, 1] warps the soma boundary: at ``0`` it is a clean
    disk; above ``0`` the per-pixel radius is modulated by a low-pass-filtered
    noise field (smoothed on the soma's own length scale), giving a lumpy outline
    that is more soma-like than a perfect circle while staying coarser than the
    optics will later blur away. Typical cortical somata are ~5–10 µm radius.

    Note — the shape is *physical*, the grid is *sampling*. This routine
    rasterizes a continuous µm-space shape onto whatever pixel grid the caller
    passes (via ``shape`` and the ``*_px`` arguments). The cell's true geometry is
    intrinsic and independent of pixel size; only how finely it is sampled depends
    on the sensor. In the normal pipeline the planted footprint is rasterized once
    at the sensor's own scale, which is fine because the result is then blurred by
    the (coarser) optics. But a caller that needs the *same* cell across multiple
    pixel sizes should generate it once on a fixed fine grid and resample, rather
    than re-rasterizing per grid — re-rasterizing re-draws the ``rng`` noise field
    at the new size and so changes the lumpy outline. This costs nothing in
    fidelity: a 1-photon miniscope is pixel-limited, never diffraction-limited
    (see :meth:`Optics.diffraction_sigma_um`), so a sub-pixel reference grid holds
    more detail than the optics can ever resolve.

    Spikes are generated on a **high-resolution grid** (``spike_sim_hz``, ~300 Hz)
    rather than at the camera frame rate, then convolved with the calcium kernel at
    that fine rate and **bin-averaged down** to the imaging rate (which is what the
    camera's exposure integration physically does). Two payoffs: one spike per fine
    bin is at most ~3 ms apart, so the **refractory period** is respected and bursts
    cannot pack unphysically tight; and sub-frame spike timing survives the kernel,
    which matters for fast indicators. (Attribution: this matches the CaLab web
    simulator's spike model.)

    Per cell, a 2-state Markov gate (quiescent ↔ active) modulates the per-bin spike
    probability between ``quiescent_rate_hz`` and ``active_rate_hz`` (each ÷
    ``spike_sim_hz``). Bursting comes from a **high in-active rate** concentrated into
    short active bouts, not from a high mean rate; :func:`bursty_spike_params` maps a
    target mean rate + burstiness onto the gate. The gate itself is stepped at the
    frame rate (bouts are ~seconds, so sub-frame onset timing is irrelevant once we
    bin); the spikes it gates are the part that runs at ``spike_sim_hz``.

    Amplitude is biology and enters as a single **per-cell** expression/response gain
    (lognormal spread ``brightness_cv``, mean 1) that scales each cell's *whole* trace
    — baseline and transients together, so a bright cell is brighter everywhere. No
    measurement noise is added here: the trace is the clean ground-truth ``C``;
    shot/read noise enter at the ``sensor`` and background at ``neuropil``, so SNR is
    emergent, never set here.

    Writes ``cell.trace`` (the calcium trace ``C``), ``cell.spikes`` (the per-frame
    spike *count* train ``S`` — the fine 300 Hz train is binned away, since nothing
    downstream recovers spikes faster than the frame rate), and ``cell.amplitude``
    (the per-cell gain); these are the ideal deconvolution targets in ground truth.
