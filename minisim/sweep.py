"""Parameter sweeps - a thin Cartesian-product generator over ``Spec`` overrides.

:func:`sweep` takes a base ``Spec`` and a dict of *dotted-path → list-of-values*
axes and yields one validated spec per point in their Cartesian product. It is the
single primitive shared by two consumers (see ``simulation-plan.md`` §"Parameter
sweeps"): ``@pytest.mark.parametrize`` correctness grids, and a benchmark harness
that collects metric values into a tidy DataFrame keyed on the physical axes. The
core :func:`~minisim.simulate.simulate` never depends on this module.

Because the physical interface makes the axes physically meaningful (depth µm,
density cells/mm², NA, exposure), a sweep traces a scientifically interpretable
surface - e.g. "recall vs depth at NA 0.45". Each yielded spec carries an
``axes`` dict (the chosen value per path) for those benchmark rows.

    Parameters
    ----------
    base
        The spec every combination starts from; never mutated.
    axes
        Maps a dotted override path to the list of values to sweep it over. Path
        forms:

        * ``"acquisition.optics.na"`` - walk nested models;
        * ``"steps.<kind>.<field>"`` - address the step with that (unique) ``kind``,

    Yields
    ------
    SweptSpec

        validators re-run** - an axis value that yields an invalid combination
        (``na=-1``, a soma larger than the FOV, …) raises here. An empty ``axes``

    ------
